# Algorithms & Analysis 2026A

## Undergraduate Project – Smart Path Finder

## Project Overview

In this project, you will design and implement a Smart Path Finder - a Python program that
computes routes between locations in a map.

The system operates on a graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent roads
connecting those locations. Each road contains information about both distance and travel
time, where travel time may vary depending on the hour of the day.

Your system must process routing queries and return meaningful path suggestions based on
diCerent criteria. You are expected to design appropriate data structures and algorithms, and
evaluate your solution through analysis and experiments.

## Problem Description

You are required to generate a graph representing a map:

- Nodes represent locations
- Edges represent roads between locations

Your graph must be designed to represent a large-scale map, including:

- Thousands of nodes
- A realistic number of edges based on real-world road networks

Each edge contains:

- A fixed value representing the distance between two nodes
- A list of 24 values, where each value represents the time required to traverse the
    edge at a given hour of the day (0–23)

This time list is expected to be updated periodically (e.g., weekly).

## Query Specification

Each query includes:

- A source node (mandatory)
- A destination node (mandatory)


- A list of nodes to avoid (optional)
- A list of edges to avoid (optional)

## Output Requirements

For each query, your system must return:

- A path that minimises total distance
- A path that minimises total travel time

For each path, your system must also report:

- The sequence of nodes in the path
- The total distance
- The total travel time

## Constraints

- Implementation must be in Python
- External libraries are not allowed
- All data structures and algorithms must be implemented by your group

## Submission Requirements
